Purpose:
 SharePoint 2013 is VERY resource hungry and some of us are stuck with development 
 environments with just 16GB of RAM. In order to actually develop in these conditions 
 we must throttle services and be very careful how we configure our development environments.
 This PowerShell script attempts to simplify the optimization process.
